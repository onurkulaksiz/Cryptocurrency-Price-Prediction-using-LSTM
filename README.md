# Cryptocurrency-Price-Prediction-using-LSTM
This project aims to demonstrate how to use the yfinance library to obtain historical cryptocurrency data and use it to train an LSTM model to predict future closing prices. The Ethereum-USD (ETH-USD) pair is used as an example, but the same approach can be applied to other cryptocurrencies and financial assets.
